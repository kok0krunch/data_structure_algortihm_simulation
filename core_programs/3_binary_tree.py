#Binary Tree Pseudocode
#Make user input numbers
#Insert the input into tree (left to right per leve)
#Let user input until maximum levels are reached (max of 5 levels, 32 inputs)
    #Ask user if they want to add another level after filling in each level. User can:
        # Add level
        # finish input
#Print Tree(?) print the traversal for tree (preorder, inorder, postorder) when any of the two ocnditions are met

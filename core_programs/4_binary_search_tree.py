# Binary Search Tree
    # Use class
        # Class attributes: top, left, right
        # Functions needed
            # First number as root
            # Determine if number is bigger or smaller
                # smaller/equal = left
                # bigger = right
            # Traverse the tree until it reaches an empty node
            # Insert in binary tree
                
    #Use definition
        # input
            #Ask user to input number (input)
        # main
            # Enable user to input until maximum input is reached(31 inputs)(Use while?)
            # If number is reached/ typed done. Print tree
